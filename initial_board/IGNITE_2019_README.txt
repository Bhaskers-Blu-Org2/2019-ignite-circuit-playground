# Welcome!
Hello Ignite - thanks for visiting the Development and Architecture Center.
What you have in your hand is a Circuit Playground Express (CPX), 
brought to you by Adafruit.

This hardware comes pre-loaded with CircuitPython! CircuitPython is Adafruit's
branch of MicroPython, designed to simplify experimentation and education on 
low-cost microcontrollers. It makes it easier than ever to get prototyping 
with Visual Studio Code.

With CircuitPython, you can write clean code to control hardware. It's great for 
beginners and is powerful for experts.

Enjoy Ignite 2019!

Thanks!
  - the Adafruit and Microsoft teams

## A quick note
The Circuit Playground Express has limited disk space so we have disabled Mac OS X indexing
which could take up that valuable space. 

So *please* do not remove the empty .fseventsd/no_log, .metadata_never_index 
or .Trashes files!

## What's on the device
The pre-loaded demo shows off some of what your Circuit Playground Express 
can do with CircuitPython:
  * The NeoPixel ring on the CPX animates with Ignite colors.
  * The switch controls the direction of the animation. Move the switch left and right to change
  the direction.
  * Press the Button A to dim the lights and Button B to brighten.
  * Touch pads labeled A1-A7 to play a scale of tones. Change the TONE_PIANO variable to False at 
  the top of the file to disable the tone piano.
  * Connecting to the serial port to print sensor, light intensity, and acceleration sensor readings
  in the console. 
  * Shake the device to pause the lights and sensor reporting.

## Quick Start

Changing the code is as easy as editing code.py in your favorite text editor.
After following setup instructions https://github.com/microsoft/2019-ignite-circuit-playground 
you can open the files in VS Code.

After the file is saved, CircuitPython will automatically reload the latest 
code. For more information, check out 
https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/creating-and-editing-code.

Connecting to the serial port will give you access to sensor information, 
better error messages and an interactive CircuitPython (known as the serial console). 
For more information on connecting to the serial console, check out
