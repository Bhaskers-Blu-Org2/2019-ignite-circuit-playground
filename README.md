# Welcome to CircuitPython and the Circuit Playground Express

This sample demonstrates the basic functionality of the Circuit Playground Express (CPX) and the Visual Studio Device Simulator Express extension.

## Getting started

Visit the CPX product page for more info on the device: https://adafruit.com/product/3333. To get started with CircuitPython, which comes built into the CPX, visit: https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython.

## Prerequisites

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Python 3.7.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  * Make sure python and pip are added to the PATH environment variables. To check whether Python has been added, type *python* in a terminal. Version 3.7.4 should print out. 
  * If installing Python, select the "Add to PATH" option to add directly on install.
  * If Python is already installed but not not a PATH variable, search for instructions given your OS.
* [Device Simulator Express extension] (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.devicesimulatorexpress)
* [Python VS Code extension extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
  * This will be automatically installed with Device Simulator Express

Win 32
Type the following commands in a console:
* **Pywin 32**: `pip install pywin32`

The following depenencies can be installed by the Device simulator Express extension by clicking yes when prompted or by typing the commands in a console:
* **Playsound**: `pip install playsound`
* **Python-Socketio**: `pip install python-socketio`
* **Reuqests**: `pip install requests`
* **Application Insights**: `pip install applicationinsights`

## Setup

Explain how to prepare the sample once the user clones or downloads the repository. The section should outline every step necessary to install dependencies and set up any settings (for example, API keys and output folders).

## Contents

Outline the file contents of the repository. It helps users navigate the codebase, build configuration and any related assets.

## Setup

Explain how to prepare the sample once the user clones or downloads the repository. The section should outline every step necessary to install dependencies and set up any settings (for example, API keys and output folders).

## Runnning the sample

Outline step-by-step instructions to execute the sample and see its output. Include steps for executing the sample from the IDE, starting specific services in the Azure portal or anything related to the overall launch of the code.

## Key concepts

Provide users with more context on the tools and services used in the sample. Explain some of the code that is being used and how services interact with each other.
